# TODO - ELLMa Improvement Plan

**Task Group: Code Generation Workflow**

1. **Do next task from TODO list.**

   * Generate code as described.
   * Run tests.

2. **If tests fail:**

   * Fix the code until all tests pass.
   * Then return to step 1.

3. **If there is a system/environment issue (e.g. missing dependency, config error):**

   * Create a new TODO task describing the issue.
   * Add it to the top of the TODO list.
   * Then return to step 1 to process it.

ðŸ”„ **Repeat without asking questions.**
Always continue to the next logical step based on test or system state.



## Security and Dependency Management (2025-06-08)
- [x] Implement core security module with environment validation
- [x] Add automatic dependency installation and repair
- [x] Create security CLI commands
- [x] Implement virtual environment management
- [x] Add security checks before code execution
- [ ] Add more security validations (file permissions, network access)
- [ ] Implement secure sandboxing for untrusted code
- [ ] Add audit logging for security-relevant actions
- [ ] Create security policy configuration
- [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability scanning

## Error Handling and Evolution
- [x] Create error logging system in ./TODO/ directory
- [x] Track errors with full context for evolution
- [ ] Implement error analysis for system improvement
- [ ] Create evolution feedback loop based on logged errors
- [ ] Add error pattern detection for common issues
- [ ] Implement automatic recovery for known error patterns

## Dependency Management and Security Layer
- [ ] Create auto-repair solution for Python dependencies
- [ ] Add dependency validation to each .py file
- [ ] Implement automatic Poetry dependency management
- [ ] Create security layer for dependency verification
- [ ] Add environment validation on module import
- [ ] Implement automatic environment repair
- [ ] Create safe execution wrapper for Python code
- [ ] Add dependency conflict resolution
- [ ] Implement security checks for all dependencies
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for missing dependencies

## Module Structure
Each module should follow this structure:
```
modules/
  [module_name]/
    Dockerfile      # For containerization
    pyproject.toml  # Dependencies and metadata
    main.py        # Main module code
    README.md      # Documentation and usage
    test.py        # Test cases
```

## Current Tasks
1. System Introspection Enhancements
   - [x] Add basic system introspection commands
   - [ ] Add more natural language patterns for command matching
   - [ ] Implement command suggestions for typos
   - [ ] Add tab completion for command arguments
   - [ ] Create interactive help system with examples

2. Error Tracking and Evolution
   - [x] Log all errors with context to ./TODO/errors.log
   - [x] Track error frequency and patterns
   - [ ] Add automated error reporting
   - [ ] Implement error severity levels
   - [ ] Create error resolution suggestions

3. Module Development
   - [x] Create base module template
   - [ ] Implement module testing framework
   - [ ] Add module documentation generator
   - [ ] Create module dependency management
   - [ ] Add module versioning support

## Long-term Goals
- Implement multi-layered control system (like in ../inceptor)
- Add testing and rollback system (like ../shellGuard)
- Create task guard to prevent unintended actions
- Improve error recovery and system resilience
- Add AI-powered command prediction
- Implement context-aware command suggestions
- Create self-healing capabilities for common issues
- Add performance optimization recommendations

## Documentation Updates Needed
- [x] Add system introspection commands to README
- [ ] Create detailed user guide for system commands
- [ ] Add examples for common troubleshooting scenarios
- [ ] Document error codes and their meanings
- [ ] Create video tutorials for key features
